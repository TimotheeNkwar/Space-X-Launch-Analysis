### ðŸš€ SpaceX Launch Data Analysis

A data analysis project focused on understanding SpaceXâ€™s launch performance and trends using publicly available launch data.  
The goal was to extract insights on success rates, launch sites, rocket types, and factors influencing launch outcomes.

#### Key Features:
- **Success Rate Analysis**: Calculated overall and yearly success rates of launches.
- **Launch Sites Comparison**: Compared performance and frequency across different launch sites.
- **Rocket Type Performance**: Analyzed how different booster versions performed over time.
- **Payload Impact**: Investigated the relationship between payload mass and mission outcome.
- **Visualizations**: Used bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and maps to present findings clearly and interactively.

> ðŸ”§ Tools used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Jupyter Notebook
